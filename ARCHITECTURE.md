# Sed MCP Server Architecture Summary

This document summarizes what we've built so far and how all the pieces fit together. Because apparently we need a roadmap to navigate this labyrinth of interfaces and mocks.

## What We Have

### Core Architecture

**Interfaces (the contracts that everything else pretends to follow):**
- `SedEngine` - Defines sed operation execution
- `FileService` - Handles file I/O operations
- `SedEngineException` - For when things go wrong

**Models (data that gets passed around):**
- `SedOperation` - Represents a single sed command with validation
- `SedResult` - Contains operation results, timing, and error information

**Mock Implementations (for testing without the real world):**
- `MockSedEngine` - Simulates sed operations with configurable failures
- `MockFileService` - In-memory file system for testing

### Testing Infrastructure

**Unit Tests:**
- `SedOperationTest` - Tests the operation model and validation
- `MockSedEngineTest` - Verifies our test infrastructure works

**Integration Tests:**
- `SedWorkflowIntegrationTest` - End-to-end workflow testing
- Covers file processing, error handling, security, and performance

**Manual Testing:**
- `SedCli` - Interactive command-line tool for testing operations
- Supports single operations, batch processing, and previews

### Build and Development

**Maven Configuration:**
- Updated `pom.xml` with testing dependencies
- JaCoCo for code coverage
- Surefire for test execution
- Shade plugin for fat JAR creation

**Documentation:**
- `SETUP.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `plan.md` - Implementation roadmap
- This summary document

## API Design

### SedEngine Interface

```java
public interface SedEngine {
    SedResult executeOperation(String content, SedOperation operation);
    SedResult executeBatch(String content, List<SedOperation> operations);
    SedResult previewOperation(String content, SedOperation operation);
    void validateOperation(SedOperation operation);
    boolean supportsOperation(SedOperation.OperationType operationType);
}
```

The interface separates concerns cleanly:
- **Execution** vs **Preview** - Real changes vs dry-run
- **Single** vs **Batch** - One operation vs multiple operations
- **Validation** - Check before execution
- **Capability** - What operations are supported

### SedOperation Model

```java
SedOperation op = SedOperation.builder()
    .operation(OperationType.SUBSTITUTE)
    .pattern("old")
    .replacement("new")
    .flags("g")
    .build();
```

Features:
- **Builder pattern** - Fluent construction with validation
- **Operation types** - SUBSTITUTE, DELETE, INSERT, APPEND, CHANGE, PRINT
- **Validation** - Required fields checked based on operation type
- **Flags support** - sed flags like 'g' (global), 'i' (ignore case)

### SedResult Model

```java
SedResult result = SedResult.builder()
    .originalContent(input)
    .modifiedContent(output)
    .success(true)
    .addChange("Applied substitution")
    .linesModified(2)
    .executionTimeMs(150)
    .build();
```

Features:
- **Immutable results** - No modification after creation
- **Change tracking** - What operations were applied
- **Performance metrics** - Execution time and lines modified
- **Error handling** - Success/failure with detailed messages

## Testing Strategy

### Three-Layer Testing

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual components in isolation
   - Models validate correctly
   - Interfaces work as expected
   - Mocks behave predictably

2. **Integration Tests** - Components working together
   - File → Process → Write workflows
   - Error propagation
   - Security validation

3. **Manual Testing** - Interactive verification
   - CLI tool for human testing
   - MCP Inspector for protocol testing

### Mock-First Development

We built mocks before real implementations because:
- **Faster feedback** - No file I/O or complex regex processing
- **Controlled testing** - Predictable failures and timing
- **Interface validation** - Ensures interfaces are usable
- **Parallel development** - Tests can be written before implementation

### Test Coverage

Current coverage focuses on:
- **Model validation** - All validation rules tested
- **Error conditions** - Various failure scenarios
- **Workflow integration** - End-to-end processes
- **Security boundaries** - Path validation and access controls

## What's Missing (The Fun Parts)

### Real Implementations

**SedEngineImpl** - Actual sed operation processing:
- Regex compilation and execution
- Address resolution (line numbers, patterns)
- Flag handling (global, case-insensitive, etc.)
- Memory-efficient processing for large files

**FileServiceImpl** - Real file system operations:
- Secure path validation
- Encoding detection and handling
- Atomic file operations with backups
- Resource management and cleanup

### MCP Integration

**SedTools** - MCP tool implementations:
- `sed_substitute` - Pattern replacement tool
- `sed_delete` - Line deletion tool
- `sed_batch` - Multiple operations tool
- `read_file` / `write_file` - File operation tools

**Application** - Main MCP server:
- Wire up real implementations
- Configure MCP server with tools
- Handle STDIO transport
- Error handling and logging

### Advanced Features

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Pattern compilation caching
- Streaming for large files
- Async processing options
- Resource limits and monitoring

**Security Enhancements:**
- Sandboxed file access
- Operation complexity limits
- Audit logging
- Input sanitization

## Why This Architecture

### Interface-Driven Design

Benefits:
- **Testability** - Easy to mock dependencies
- **Flexibility** - Swap implementations without changing clients
- **Clarity** - Explicit contracts between components

Drawbacks:
- **Complexity** - More classes and abstractions
- **Overhead** - Extra indirection and interfaces

### Builder Pattern for Models

Benefits:
- **Validation** - Check constraints during construction
- **Immutability** - Objects can't be modified after creation
- **Readability** - Clear, fluent construction syntax

Drawbacks:
- **Verbosity** - More code than simple constructors
- **Learning curve** - Developers need to understand the pattern

### Comprehensive Testing

Benefits:
- **Confidence** - Changes less likely to break existing functionality
- **Documentation** - Tests show how code should be used
- **Refactoring support** - Safe to change implementations

Drawbacks:
- **Development time** - More time spent writing tests
- **Maintenance** - Tests need to be kept up-to-date

## Integration Points

### With MCP Protocol

The sed engine integrates with MCP through tool implementations:

```java
// MCP tool wraps sed engine
public String executeSedSubstitute(String text, String pattern, String replacement, String flags) {
    SedOperation op = SedOperation.builder()
        .operation(OperationType.SUBSTITUTE)
        .pattern(pattern)
        .replacement(replacement)
        .flags(flags)
        .build();
    
    SedResult result = sedEngine.executeOperation(text, op);
    return result.getModifiedContent();
}
```

### With File System

File operations are abstracted through the FileService:

```java
// Safe file processing workflow
fileService.validatePath(userPath, allowedBasePath);
String content = fileService.readFile(userPath);
Path backup = fileService.createBackup(userPath);
SedResult result = sedEngine.executeOperation(content, operation);
fileService.writeFile(userPath, result.getModifiedContent());
```

### With CLI Tool

The CLI provides direct access for testing:

```java
// Interactive testing
SedEngine engine = new MockSedEngine();
SedCli cli = new SedCli(engine);
cli.run(); // Interactive session
```

## Next Development Steps

1. **Implement real SedEngine** - Replace mock with actual sed processing
2. **Implement real FileService** - Replace mock with file system operations
3. **Create MCP tool wrappers** - Bridge sed operations to MCP protocol
4. **Update main Application** - Wire everything together for MCP server
5. **Performance testing** - Ensure acceptable performance with large files
6. **Security review** - Validate all security measures are effective

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Interface-first design** made testing much easier
- **Mock implementations** allowed rapid development and testing
- **Builder pattern** caught validation errors early
- **Comprehensive testing** gave confidence in refactoring

### What Could Be Better

- **More granular interfaces** - Some interfaces try to do too much
- **Better error hierarchies** - More specific exception types
- **Async support** - Current design is purely synchronous
- **Configuration management** - Hard-coded values should be configurable

### Development Process

The approach of:
1. Define interfaces
2. Build mocks
3. Write tests
4. Implement real code

Actually worked better than expected. It forced us to think about the API design before implementation details, and the mocks made it easy to test error conditions that would be hard to reproduce with real implementations.

## Conclusion

We've built a solid foundation for a sed-based MCP server with:
- Clean interface abstractions
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Manual testing tools
- Build and development setup

The architecture is flexible enough to support the planned sed operations while being testable and maintainable. The mock implementations provide a safety net for development and a reference for the real implementations.

Now we just need to implement the actual sed processing. How hard could that be?

(Spoiler: Famous last words.)
